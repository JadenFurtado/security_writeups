# Let's talk common sense in cybersecurity and software development,
## because common sense is not that common!

* These are taken from my past experiences

### Storing passwords in plain text:
Please don't store passwords in plain texts üôè.

### Storing password hints and plain text password next to the hash:
The skill and genius required for this is out of this world and yet I have come across this in real life!

Why even bother to hash the passwords in the 1st place if you are storing the plain text password?

### Returning sensitive information to all users:
Just fetching information and not displaying it does not make an application secure! It just hides the information from the regular user, that's all.
Below is a real example that discloses the IP, Pan card number, Address, mobile number, password, email-id and a ton of other data

### Not sanitizing user inputs:

General rule of thumb in coding, do not trust your users! You never know what they might cook up

### Depending on a WAF to shield against an intrusion

While using a WAF is good and all, depending on it alone is not good enough. Why? see the below gif
