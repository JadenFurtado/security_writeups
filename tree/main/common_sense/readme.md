# Let's talk common sense in cybersecurity and software development,
## because common sense is not that common!

These are taken from my past experiences. Over the years, I have had to deal with increasingly stupid people, who refuse to do what is needed and end up exposing themselves as well as others, which for me, is the most frustrating thing ever.
