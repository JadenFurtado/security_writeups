# Orona Ltd

I came across an insecure server belonging to Orona Ltd, a european company during work. 
This is the writeup of how I exploited the vulnerabilities to gain access to client and business records and tons of sensitive documents

Orona were kind enough to get back to me ASAP and fixed the issue, kudos to them.
