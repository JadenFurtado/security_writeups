## Just a few FAQs:

### Am I real hacker or just a script kiddie?

Well, I am no one to call myself a real hacker, but I am most certainly no script kiddie. I know the theory behind everything that I do. I occasionally use tools like SQLmap, Metasploit, Burp, etc… when manual testing is too tiresome. But I prefer to write and develop my own tools, generally in python(all those libraries, they make development easy!). 

### What do I hack and what can I hack?

I am currently into hacking websites, servers and web-based technologies. That being said, I can hack pretty much anything that runs on a computer or has a computer. 

### Why do I do this?

I do this because I can and for fun. I try not to do this for profit or for any recognition. That being said, if money or recognition does come my way, I won’t say no! 

### Have I ever committed a cybercrime?

No. I have never done nor supported any criminal hacking. I have never hacked anyone or any company to cause them harm and have always responsibly disclosed all the vulnerabilities that I have found till date. I have never asked for money to disclose a vulnerability and never held anyone to ransom. 
### Not all hackers are criminals 

### Why am I putting these writeups out here?

To be honest, I am the kind of guy who is generally shy and who does not like any publicity. However, I have found that it helps me improve myself, when I have other, more experienced people critique my work, especially in hacking.

### Have I written malware?

Yes, I have written a few viruses. You can find the repository of one such virus <a href="https://github.com/JadenFurtado/php_virus">Here</a>.

### Am I open to pentesting for your company/corporation?

Currently I am working with R.U.D.R.A. secure( https://rudrasecure.com/ ), a cybersecurity startup, based in Mumbai as an offensive security engineer. Let's trade emails!
