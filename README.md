# My hacking career:

![Alt text](https://github.com/JadenFurtado/JadenFurtado/blob/main/istockphoto-502860430-612x612.jpg?raw=true)

I have always found hacking as an escape from stress and pressure, where I get to write the rules and others play by them. Also, it is really cute to see peoples reactions when they ask me what I do in my past time! Goes without saying, I have never used my skills to cause anyone damage or harm in anyway. I have hacked numerous websites for fun and to pass time. I have done everything from SQL injections, XSS, CSRFs to exploiting business logic errors and I have taken down quite a few corporations (I can’t name any, given my NDAs with said corporations) software and websites.

Only those security writeups that I am allowed to put out.

Note: These represent PART and only PART of all the hacking that I have done. The rest I can't put out as I am bound by NDAs.

## My writeups:

## Just a few FAQs:

### Am I real hacker or just a script kiddie?

Well, I am no one to call myself a real hacker, but I am most certainly no script kiddie. I know the theory behind everything that I do. I occasionally use tools like SQLmap, Metasploit, Burp, etc… when manual testing is too tiresome. But I prefer to write and develop my own tools, generally in python(all those libraries, they make development easy!). 

### What do I hack and what can I hack?

I am currently into hacking websites, servers and web-based technologies. That being said, I can hack pretty much anything that runs on a computer or has a computer. 

### Why do I do this?

I do this because I can and for fun. I try not to do this for profit or for any recognition. That being said, if money or recognition does come my way, I won’t say no! 

### How good am I?

I am not the best or an expert at any of this. I love technology and computers and maths and well, just problem solving in general. I want to learn and pickup whatever I can, whenever I can. All I want to do is to become better at what I do, be it maths, developing software or even cyber security.  

### Have I ever committed a cybercrime?

No. I have never done nor supported any criminal hacking. I have never hacked anyone or any company to cause them harm. I have always responsibly disclosed all the vulnerabilities that I have found till date. I have never asked a company for money to disclose a vulnerability and never held anyone to ransom over a vulnerability. 
### Not all hackers are criminals 

### Why am I putting these writeups out here?

To be honest, I am the kind of guy who is generally shy and who does not like any publicity. However, I have found that it helps me improve myself, when I have other, more experienced people critique my work, especially in hacking.

### Have I written malware?

Yes, I have written a few viruses. You can find the repository of one such virus in my github account.

### Am I open to pentesting for your company/corporation?

Sure. Let's trade emails! Contact me at furtadojaden@gmail.com  .
