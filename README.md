# security_writeups
A list of all the security writeups from my work as a security researcher that I am allowed to put out.

## Just a few FAQs:

### What do I hack and what can I hack?

I am currently into hacking websites, servers and web-based technologies. That being said, I can hack pretty much anything that runs on a computer or has a computer. 

### Why do I do this?

I do this because I can and for fun. I try not to do this for profit or for any recognition. That being said, if money or recognition does come my way, I wonâ€™t say no! 

### How good am I?

I am not the best or an expert at any of this. I love technology and computers and maths and well, just problem solving in general. All I want to do is to become better at what I do, be it maths, developing software or even cyber security .
