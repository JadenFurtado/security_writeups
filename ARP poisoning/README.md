## Introduction:
Just a writeup on ARP poisoning, based on everything that I know and have studied about the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to help me retain my knowledge.

## What is ARP?
ARP is short for address resolution protocol. As the name suggests, it is used to convert the IP address of a machine to it's MAC address. This protocol operates in the Data Link layer of the OSI model.
