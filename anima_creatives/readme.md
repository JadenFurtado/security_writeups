### Anima Creatives management

The time I hacked a modelling agency. In all fairness, I tried my best to get the attention of the agencies involved here. 
Only when they did not respond to my mails and all other options that I tried failed, I decided to go ahead and exploit the vulnerabilities to get it to their attention and fix the flaws.
