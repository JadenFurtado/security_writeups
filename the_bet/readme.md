# The bet

## Inroduction:

Long story short. A friend of mine challenged me to hack the company at which his dad was working. So, I obliged. 
The website belongs to a diamond trading agency. I was able to exploit a business logic error and take over the companyâ€™s website and effectively the company itself.
This among the more interesting hacks that I have done till date. Why? Because at 1st glance, everything seems fine, until you notice the flaw. Done for fun, not for profit.
